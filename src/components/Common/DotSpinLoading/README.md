# Eargo UI Components - DotSpinLoading

DotSpinLoading will add a layer on DOM with a spinner that we can use to indicate the loading process, and we can prevent extra activity by a user with this component.

### Example

#### DotSpinLoading:

```javascript
<DotSpinLoading />
```


### Use to pass Props 

##### className {string} (Optional)
If you want to add your own style or modify current CSS then you can pass your value on `className` prop.


##### bgEffect {string} (Optional) (transparent || blur)
`bgEffect` is an optional prop and the default value is `blur`. If you want to set background blur during the loading then you can set it as blur, or if you want to set it transparent then pass `transparent` in prop for bgEffect.
